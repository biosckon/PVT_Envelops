# PVT_Envelops
Dynamic Equations of State. Influenced by Bret Victor Dynamic Visualizations.

### Inspiration
- Visualize EOS (or any large equation for that matter).
- EOS with all the controlling parameters exposed as draggable, scrollable elements.

### Implementation
- Super Easy import of components and experiments
- Web/ Electron/ React (JS and Native) as visual foundation.
- Logic in JS (narually).
- D3 for vis?
